Relation classification aims to categorize into predefined classes the relations btw pairs of given entities in texts. There are two ways to represent relations between entities using: recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We have tried RNNs for this project.

We have implemented three LSTM-RNN architectures for solving the task of relation classification:
* [Relation classification using LSTM Networks along Shortest Dependency Paths.](https://github.com/Sshanu/Relation-Classification/tree/master/LCA%20Shortest%20Path)
* [Relation classification using bidirectional LSTM Networks on LCA Sub Tree.](https://github.com/Sshanu/Relation-Classification/tree/master/LCA%20SubTree)
* [Relation classification using LSTMS on Sequences and Tree Structures.](https://github.com/Sshanu/Relation-Classification/tree/master/LSTM%20Seq%20and%20Tree)

We achieve better performance for solving the task of relation classification using the last approach "[Classification using LSTMS on Sequences and Tree Structures.](https://github.com/Sshanu/Relation-Classification/tree/master/LSTM%20Seq%20and%20Tree)".
